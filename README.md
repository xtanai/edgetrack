# EdgeTrack

EdgeTrack is designed as a deterministic capture backend for professional 3D authoring and interaction systems.

**EdgeTrack** is an on-edge capture and preprocessing stack for synchronized **RAW10 mono multi-camera** pipelines, targeting **Raspberry Pi 5 (primary)** or **Radxa Dragon Q6A (secondary)**.
It provides **deterministic camera I/O**, **calibration-aware undistortion/normalization**, and **on-edge stereo reconstruction** to output **metric-scale 3D keypoints derived from calibrated stereo geometry**, with time-consistent sampling (error bounds depend on calibration and mechanics). Optionally, EdgeTrack can publish **ROI-reduced sparse 3D point clouds** to a host over **Gigabit LAN**.

EdgeTrack is designed to pair with **[TDMStrobe](https://github.com/xtanai/tdmstrobe)** and **[CoreFusion](https://github.com/xtanai/corefusion)** to deliver stable synchronization, low-latency capture, and **deterministic NIR illumination**. TDMStrobe provides hardware-timed strobe control aligned to camera triggers and can coordinate illumination using an **A/B/C/D phase sequence** across multiple rigs to reduce cross-talk and keep exposure consistent. CoreFusion ingests the time-aligned outputs from multiple EdgeTrack nodes over **Gigabit Ethernet** and fuses them into a coherent representation (e.g., multi-view keypoints, tracks, or sparse geometry) with predictable timing and well-defined latency.

> **Status:** early prototype. APIs, wiring, and schemas may change.

## Features

* **Metric 3D on the edge:** On-device stereo reconstruction outputs **metric 3D keypoints** (and optional sparse ROI point clouds) instead of raw video streams or purely 2D detections.
* **RAW-first capture:** **RAW10** preserves linear sensor data at the edge, avoiding ISP-induced artifacts that can reduce calibration accuracy and stereo stability.
* **Deterministic timing:** Synchronized **global-shutter sensors** with **TDM strobe phases** enable repeatable capture timing and consistent geometry.
* **850/940 nm IR-ready:** Supports **850 nm or 940 nm** illumination (sensor- and filter-dependent) for stable, ambient-robust imaging and improved user comfort.
* **Multi-mode illumination:** **NIR flood** is optimized for close range (≈ **up to 1.2 m**). **VCSEL pattern projection** is optimized for medium range (≈ **1.2–10 m**) and can also help at closer distances in low-texture scenes.
* **Linux on the edge:** A Linux-based stack enables robust deployment and long-term maintainability (drivers, networking, tooling).
* **Ethernet-first networking:** Designed for **wired Ethernet** (PoE where applicable) to deliver predictable bandwidth, low jitter, and reliable multi-rig synchronization.
* **Bandwidth-efficient output:** Transmits **3D keypoints, sparse ROI point clouds, and references**—no raw video streaming required. An optional **high-quality H.265 preview** is available for monitoring and setup.
* **Scales across rigs:** Each device runs a **2-camera stereo pair at the edge**; combine **2–8 stereo rigs** over Ethernet to cover larger capture volumes and **significantly reduce occlusions** via multi-view geometry.
* **Low-latency pipeline:** Edge-side preprocessing and triangulation reduce host load and end-to-end latency.
* **Marker-optional:** Gloveless by default; optional **wristbands** can improve arm stability; **fingertip markers** enable the highest precision.
* **Optional tracked peripherals:** Supports tracked tools such as **VR headset markers, 3D pens/styluses, and props**, enabling high-precision workflows beyond hand tracking.
* **Optional GPU/NPU AI assist:** Used for robustness enhancements such as disambiguation, confidence estimation, and failure detection. In multi-view setups (**>2 cameras**), geometric redundancy typically reduces reliance on AI-based methods.
* **Optional RGB helper camera:** A center RGB camera can assist setup (visual inspection, text/marker reading, calibration aids) **without entering the reconstruction path**.

## Safety

### NIR Illumination (850 nm vs 940 nm) & Eye Safety

* **Never look into emitters.** Use black matte **baffles/shields**, aim emitters away from faces, and add **hardware interlocks** (LEDs off on loss of sync, open covers, or presence detection).
* Keep **exposure short** (strobe pulses strictly within camera exposure) and **average irradiance low**.
* Prefer **850 nm band-pass filters** on cameras to reduce the required LED output power.
* **850 nm and 940 nm are both IR-A** and are **not inherently eye-safe**; safety depends on irradiance, geometry, duty cycle, distance, and exposure time (IEC 62471).

### Solution Strategies

**Option A — Prefer more viewpoints over more power (recommended for 940 nm)**
- If **940 nm illumination** is preferred (reduced visible glow), the recommended approach is to **increase the number of stereo rigs (viewpoints)** to maintain SNR while keeping **irradiance low**, rather than compensating with higher-power NIR emitters.

**Option B — Side / rear placement (recommended)**
- Mount stereo pairs **left/right and slightly behind** the workspace, aimed toward the work area. Add **one or two top stereo pairs** for occlusion-free coverage. This directs NIR **away from the eyes** while maintaining uniform scene illumination.
Future refinement: recess-mount one stereo pair near the table center and another near the back edge for a slimmer, more robust setup.

**Option C — Front placement with HMD only**
- If stereo pairs must face forward, operate with a **closed VR headset** (no see-through optics) so the user’s eyes are **occluded**. Baffles and interlocks are still required to protect bystanders.

**Option D — IR-filtering safety eyewear**
- Use **visible-light-transmitting eyewear** that strongly attenuates **near-IR (≈ 780–950 nm)** (specified optical density at **850 nm / 940 nm**) so users retain normal vision while IR exposure is reduced.

**Option E — Side-shield eyewear (“horse-blinkers” concept)**
- Provide **IR-blocking safety glasses with side shields** for operators and visitors when emitters face forward. Ensure proper **near-IR attenuation ratings** and a snug fit to block off-axis radiation. and ensure a snug fit to block off-axis light.
